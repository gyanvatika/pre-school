At that point in time, Preschool education was at its nascent best. The market was ruled by unprofessional household preschools and parents questioned the very wisdom of sending children to a Play school.\r\nAt our Play schools, a child is introduced to a world where companionship and sharing become a daily routine. This forms the basis of a child's ability to function in a social environment beyond the familiarity of his home and the process of being socially adept gradually gains momentum. The whole environment is such that it inspires curiosity in a child and this is invariably followed with a lot of queries. We make sure that these queries are answered and explained in the most encouraging manner. The sheer quality of the interaction that the child undergoes is sufficient in guaranteeing that the most critical aspects of growing up like developing an academic aptitude and becoming emotionally mature are taken care of.\r\n\r\nWe researched into the realm of Preschool education and realized that most brands weren't able to provide a resourceful and effective platform that was necessary to ascertain and develop the inherent but undeveloped talent that was hidden within each child. This is why we took it upon ourselves to create a Pre-primary education system that was capable of assessing and developing the academic, physical, emotional and cognitive skills of a child. With its vast & rich experience, the Shyama Educational Group has formulated a strategy for future growth of this young edifice of education by entering into the pre-primary education and launching Gyan vatika play school  ...a play school. Gyan vatika play school  cater to the educational and upbringing needs of children between 2-5 years.\r\nGyan vatika play school  being the most prominent names in preschool educators, it had been serving the young minds aged between 02-05 years since 2010. It is a matter of pride for us that the students & the parents associated with us not only appreciates us but they also keep inspiring us to bring more innovation in the playschool education. We have accomplished 1000+ schools in a decade, that are spread across the corners of rural, urban,& suburban areas. We are determined to make the best of preschool education available in the darkest corner of the society. We strive to become a school with the best facilities & academics that offers education to everyone.\r\nIn the success journey so far, we have made several achievements but to mention a few, Prism art & Speak-o-Book have been the best so far. With prism art, we have been able to map 100% content of our syllabus into e-learning interactive modules, which renders the smart class across Gyan vatika play school  and also s schools for the in-depth learning &virtual experiences.

The idea is to provide children with an unrestricted option of activities to choose from and then help them identify their preferences or dislikes and then refining their preferences in a more productive manner. We use a combination of traditional preschool favorite activities such Art and Dance programs and the latest that the world of multimedia has to offer to ensure that the child doesn't develop a sense of discomfort with the things that would soon make up his surroundings.\r\n\r\nThis in turn, makes the child more dexterous and positive in his approach when it comes to accomplishing a task no matter how difficult it is again, a tool that every child should have as they make the transition from being a preschooler to a school-going student to a grown-up individual.\r\n\r\n\r\nLibrary: We have taken it upon ourselves to be self-sustaining when it comes to using various teaching/learning tools including books and manuals that are used by our educators. As a result of our continued effort that has involved immeasurable man-hours and the guidance of innumerable experts in the field, we have developed our own Library or the Information Resource Section as we usually call it. Some of the books have been developed by our own educational experts while some of the titles have been co-authored by collaborating with other Preschool specialists.\r\n\r\nYet, we haven't stopped with our efforts in this regard and a dedicated team of scholars and research people continue to explore and update us on the better and innovative teaching methods for creating a more dynamic, easily acceptable and concept-based method of learning. In fact, we have a team of authors, co-authors, editors and proof-readers who are responsible for creating, periodically checking and updating our study material and every piece of data that is related with our brand.\r\n\r\nSoft Skills Training: We lay emphasis when it comes to a student's attitude that is exhibited towards learning something new or when dealing with difficult situations and adapting to diverse situations in general. It is in this regard that rather than insisting upon carrying out repetitive and mundane classroom activities that most preschools tend to do, our teachers have been asked to make sure that the child develops the right propensity to make an individual decision and is prepared for higher education through curiosity and self-acceptance rather than being forced towards it. Thus, we help inculcate the desired aptitude in each child whether it comes to being receptive for further learning, being socially adaptable or having a positive mindset.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
